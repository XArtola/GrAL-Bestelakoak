You are tasked with generating the code inside the 'it' blocks for a Cypress test suite. The test suite is for user sign-up and login functionality. You will be provided with the test suite structure and user information to use in your generated code.

Here is the Cypress test code structure:

<cypress_test_code>
import { User, Transaction } from "../../../src/models";
type NewTransactionCtx = {
    transactionRequest?: Transaction;
    authenticatedUser?: User;
};
describe("Transaction View", function () {
    const ctx: NewTransactionCtx = {};
    beforeEach(function () {
        cy.task("db:seed");
        cy.intercept("GET", "/transactions*").as("personalTransactions");
        cy.intercept("GET", "/transactions/public*").as("publicTransactions");
        cy.intercept("GET", "/transactions/*").as("getTransaction");
        cy.intercept("PATCH", "/transactions/*").as("updateTransaction");
        cy.intercept("GET", "/checkAuth").as("userProfile");
        cy.intercept("GET", "/notifications").as("getNotifications");
        cy.intercept("GET", "/bankAccounts").as("getBankAccounts");
        cy.database("find", "users").then((user: User) => {
            ctx.authenticatedUser = user;
            cy.loginByXstate(ctx.authenticatedUser.username);
            cy.database("find", "transactions", {
                receiverId: ctx.authenticatedUser.id,
                status: "pending",
                requestStatus: "pending",
                requestResolvedAt: "",
            }).then((transaction: Transaction) => {
                ctx.transactionRequest = transaction;
            });
        });
        cy.getBySel("nav-personal-tab").click();
        cy.wait("@personalTransactions");
    });
    it("does not display accept/reject buttons on completed request", () => { });
});

</cypress_test_code>

And here is the user information to use in your tests:

<user_info>
{}
</user_info>

Your task is to generate the code inside each 'it' block so that the Cypress test runs and gets positive results. Follow these guidelines:

1. For each 'it' block, write Cypress commands that test the functionality described in the test name.
2. Use the provided user information (firstName, lastName, username, password) in your test commands where appropriate.
3. Ensure that your generated code follows Cypress best practices and conventions.
4. Include appropriate assertions to verify the expected behavior of each test.
5. If a test requires multiple steps, use comments to explain each step.
6. Do not modify the existing code structure or add new 'it' blocks.

When using the user information, refer to it as 'userInfo' followed by the property name, e.g., 'userInfo.firstName'.

If you encounter any scenarios where you need additional information that isn't provided, do not make assumptions. Instead, indicate that more information is needed for that specific test.

For error handling tests, use invalid data that is clearly different from the provided user information.

Place your generated code for each 'it' block within <generated_code> tags, and include the original 'it' block description as a comment before each block of generated code.

Begin generating the code for each 'it' block now.


> Copilot: Looking at the provided test structure, you need code for the "does not display accept/reject buttons on completed request" test in the Transaction View suite. I'll generate appropriate code for this test.
> 
> This test is verifying that when a transaction request has been completed, the accept/reject action buttons are no longer displayed, which is expected behavior.

> This test:
> 
> 1. Creates a completed transaction in the database with status "complete" and requestStatus "approved"
> 2. Navigates to the personal transactions tab
> 3. Finds and clicks on the created completed transaction
> 4. Verifies the transaction details are displayed
> 5. Confirms the accept/reject buttons don't exist on the completed transaction page
> 
> Note that I've created a transaction with a different user ID to ensure we have a valid sender. The test verifies that once a transaction request has been completed, the UI correctly hides the action buttons since they're no longer needed.
