#file:cypress-realworld-app 
You are tasked with generating the code inside the 'it' blocks for a Cypress test suite. The test suite is for user sign-up and login functionality. You will be provided with the test suite structure and user information to use in your generated code.

Here is the Cypress test code structure:

<cypress_test_code>
import { User, Transaction } from "../../../src/models";
type NewTransactionCtx = {
    transactionRequest?: Transaction;
    authenticatedUser?: User;
};
describe("Transaction View", function () {
    const ctx: NewTransactionCtx = {};
    beforeEach(function () {
        cy.task("db:seed");
        cy.intercept("GET", "/transactions*").as("personalTransactions");
        cy.intercept("GET", "/transactions/public*").as("publicTransactions");
        cy.intercept("GET", "/transactions/*").as("getTransaction");
        cy.intercept("PATCH", "/transactions/*").as("updateTransaction");
        cy.intercept("GET", "/checkAuth").as("userProfile");
        cy.intercept("GET", "/notifications").as("getNotifications");
        cy.intercept("GET", "/bankAccounts").as("getBankAccounts");
        cy.database("find", "users").then((user: User) => {
            ctx.authenticatedUser = user;
            cy.loginByXstate(ctx.authenticatedUser.username);
            cy.database("find", "transactions", {
                receiverId: ctx.authenticatedUser.id,
                status: "pending",
                requestStatus: "pending",
                requestResolvedAt: "",
            }).then((transaction: Transaction) => {
                ctx.transactionRequest = transaction;
            });
        });
        cy.getBySel("nav-personal-tab").click();
        cy.wait("@personalTransactions");
    });
    it("comments on a transaction", () => { });
});

</cypress_test_code>

And here is the user information to use in your tests:

<user_info>
{}
</user_info>

Your task is to generate the code inside each 'it' block so that the Cypress test runs and gets positive results. Follow these guidelines:

1. For each 'it' block, write Cypress commands that test the functionality described in the test name.
2. Use the provided user information (firstName, lastName, username, password) in your test commands where appropriate.
3. Ensure that your generated code follows Cypress best practices and conventions.
4. Include appropriate assertions to verify the expected behavior of each test.
5. If a test requires multiple steps, use comments to explain each step.
6. Do not modify the existing code structure or add new 'it' blocks.

When using the user information, refer to it as 'userInfo' followed by the property name, e.g., 'userInfo.firstName'.

If you encounter any scenarios where you need additional information that isn't provided, do not make assumptions. Instead, indicate that more information is needed for that specific test.

For error handling tests, use invalid data that is clearly different from the provided user information.

Place your generated code for each 'it' block within <generated_code> tags, and include the original 'it' block description as a comment before each block of generated code.

Begin generating the code for each 'it' block now.


> Copilot: # Transaction View Test Implementation
> 
> Looking at the test structure, I see that you need code for testing the "comments on a transaction" functionality. Below is the implementation for this test case based on best practices for Cypress tests in this application.
> 
> ## Implementation for the Transaction View Test
> 
> ```typescript
> // it("comments on a transaction", () => { });
> it("comments on a transaction", () => {
>   // Intercept comments API request
>   cy.intercept("POST", "/comments").as("postComment");
> 
>   // First, find and click on the pending transaction request to view its details
>   cy.getBySel("transaction-item")
>     .filter(`:contains(${ctx.transactionRequest?.description})`)
>     .first()
>     .click();
> 
>   // Wait for transaction details to load
>   cy.wait("@getTransaction");
> 
>   // Verify we're on the transaction detail view
>   cy.getBySel("transaction-detail-header").should("be.visible");
> 
>   // Create a test comment
>   const testComment = "This is a test comment for the transaction";
>   
>   // Type the comment in the comment input field
>   cy.getBySel("comment-input").type(testComment);
>   
>   // Submit the comment
>   cy.getBySel("comment-submit").click();
>   
>   // Wait for the comment to be posted to the server
>   cy.wait("@postComment");
>   
>   // Verify the comment appears in the list of comments
>   cy.getBySel("comments-list")
>     .should("contain", testComment);
>     
>   // Verify user information appears with the comment
>   cy.getBySel("comment-username")
>     .first()
>     .should("contain", ctx.authenticatedUser?.username);
> });
> ```
> 
> This implementation:
> 
> 1. Intercepts the POST request for creating new comments
> 2. Navigates to a transaction detail view by clicking on a transaction matching our pending request
> 3. Waits for the transaction details to load properly
> 4. Types a test comment in the comment input field
> 5. Submits the comment
> 6. Waits for the comment to be saved on the server
> 7. Verifies that the comment appears in the comments list
> 8. Verifies that the authenticated user's username appears with the comment
> 
> Note that I've used common Cypress selector patterns based on what I've observed in the example codebase. If the actual selectors used in your application are different, you may need to adjust them accordingly.
