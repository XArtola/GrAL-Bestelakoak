You are tasked with generating the code inside the 'it' blocks for a Cypress test suite. The test suite is for user sign-up and login functionality. You will be provided with the test suite structure and user information to use in your generated code.

Here is the Cypress test code structure:

<cypress_test_code>
import { isMobile } from "../../support/utils";
import { User, Transaction } from "../../../src/models";
type NotificationsCtx = {
    userA: User;
    userB: User;
    userC: User;
};
describe("Notifications", function () {
    const ctx = {} as NotificationsCtx;
    beforeEach(function () {
        cy.task("db:seed");
        cy.intercept("GET", "/notifications*").as("getNotifications");
        cy.intercept("POST", "/transactions").as("createTransaction");
        cy.intercept("PATCH", "/notifications/*").as("updateNotification");
        cy.intercept("POST", "/comments/*").as("postComment");
        cy.database("filter", "users").then((users: User[]) => {
            ctx.userA = users[0];
            ctx.userB = users[1];
            ctx.userC = users[2];
        });
    });
    describe("notifications from user interactions", function () {
        it("User C likes a transaction between User A and User B; User A and User B get notifications that User C liked transaction", () => { });
    });
});

</cypress_test_code>

And here is the user information to use in your tests:

<user_info>
{}
</user_info>

Your task is to generate the code inside each 'it' block so that the Cypress test runs and gets positive results. Follow these guidelines:

1. For each 'it' block, write Cypress commands that test the functionality described in the test name.
2. Use the provided user information (firstName, lastName, username, password) in your test commands where appropriate.
3. Ensure that your generated code follows Cypress best practices and conventions.
4. Include appropriate assertions to verify the expected behavior of each test.
5. If a test requires multiple steps, use comments to explain each step.
6. Do not modify the existing code structure or add new 'it' blocks.

When using the user information, refer to it as 'userInfo' followed by the property name, e.g., 'userInfo.firstName'.

If you encounter any scenarios where you need additional information that isn't provided, do not make assumptions. Instead, indicate that more information is needed for that specific test.

For error handling tests, use invalid data that is clearly different from the provided user information.

Place your generated code for each 'it' block within <generated_code> tags, and include the original 'it' block description as a comment before each block of generated code.

Begin generating the code for each 'it' block now.


> Copilot: Looking at the test description, I need to create code for a test that demonstrates User C liking a transaction between User A and User B, and verifying that both User A and User B receive notifications about User C's like.
> 
> Here's my implementation:
> 
> ```typescript
> // User C likes a transaction between User A and User B; User A and User B get notifications that User C liked transaction
> it("User C likes a transaction between User A and User B; User A and User B get notifications that User C liked transaction", () => {
>     // Login as User A
>     cy.loginByXstate(ctx.userA.username);
>     
>     // Create a transaction between User A and User B
>     cy.visit("/transaction/new");
>     cy.getBySel("user-list-item").contains(ctx.userB.firstName).click();
>     cy.getBySel("amount-input").type("50");
>     cy.getBySel("transaction-create-description-input").type("Test transaction for like notification");
>     cy.getBySel("transaction-create-submit-payment").click();
>     cy.wait("@createTransaction");
>     
>     // Get the transaction ID from the URL
>     let transactionId: string;
>     cy.url().then(url => {
>         transactionId = url.split("/").pop()!;
>         
>         // Log out as User A
>         cy.getBySel("sidenav-signout").click();

> This implementation follows these steps:
> 1. Logs in as User A and creates a transaction with User B
> 2. Extracts the transaction ID from the URL for later use
> 3. Logs out and logs in as User C
> 4. Has User C visit the transaction and like it
> 5. Checks that User A receives a notification about the like
> 6. Checks that User B receives a notification about the like
> 
> The test includes appropriate waiting for network requests and assertions to verify the notifications are correctly displayed to both users.
