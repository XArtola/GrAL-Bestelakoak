#file:cypress-realworld-app 
You are tasked with generating the code inside the 'it' blocks for a Cypress test suite. The test suite is for user sign-up and login functionality. You will be provided with the test suite structure and user information to use in your generated code.

Here is the Cypress test code structure:

<cypress_test_code>
import { User, Transaction } from "../../../src/models";
type NewTransactionCtx = {
    transactionRequest?: Transaction;
    authenticatedUser?: User;
};
describe("Transaction View", function () {
    const ctx: NewTransactionCtx = {};
    beforeEach(function () {
        cy.task("db:seed");
        cy.intercept("GET", "/transactions*").as("personalTransactions");
        cy.intercept("GET", "/transactions/public*").as("publicTransactions");
        cy.intercept("GET", "/transactions/*").as("getTransaction");
        cy.intercept("PATCH", "/transactions/*").as("updateTransaction");
        cy.intercept("GET", "/checkAuth").as("userProfile");
        cy.intercept("GET", "/notifications").as("getNotifications");
        cy.intercept("GET", "/bankAccounts").as("getBankAccounts");
        cy.database("find", "users").then((user: User) => {
            ctx.authenticatedUser = user;
            cy.loginByXstate(ctx.authenticatedUser.username);
            cy.database("find", "transactions", {
                receiverId: ctx.authenticatedUser.id,
                status: "pending",
                requestStatus: "pending",
                requestResolvedAt: "",
            }).then((transaction: Transaction) => {
                ctx.transactionRequest = transaction;
            });
        });
        cy.getBySel("nav-personal-tab").click();
        cy.wait("@personalTransactions");
    });
    it("likes a transaction", () => { });
});

</cypress_test_code>

And here is the user information to use in your tests:

<user_info>
{}
</user_info>

Your task is to generate the code inside each 'it' block so that the Cypress test runs and gets positive results. Follow these guidelines:

1. For each 'it' block, write Cypress commands that test the functionality described in the test name.
2. Use the provided user information (firstName, lastName, username, password) in your test commands where appropriate.
3. Ensure that your generated code follows Cypress best practices and conventions.
4. Include appropriate assertions to verify the expected behavior of each test.
5. If a test requires multiple steps, use comments to explain each step.
6. Do not modify the existing code structure or add new 'it' blocks.

When using the user information, refer to it as 'userInfo' followed by the property name, e.g., 'userInfo.firstName'.

If you encounter any scenarios where you need additional information that isn't provided, do not make assumptions. Instead, indicate that more information is needed for that specific test.

For error handling tests, use invalid data that is clearly different from the provided user information.

Place your generated code for each 'it' block within <generated_code> tags, and include the original 'it' block description as a comment before each block of generated code.

Begin generating the code for each 'it' block now.


> Copilot: I'll help you generate the code for the test case in the transaction view test suite. Let's implement the "likes a transaction" test:
> 
> ```typescript
> // Test: likes a transaction
> it("likes a transaction", () => {
>     // Find a transaction in the personal feed
>     cy.getBySel("transaction-item")
>         .first()
>         .click();
> 
>     // Wait for transaction details to load
>     cy.wait("@getTransaction");
> 
>     // Get initial like count
>     cy.getBySel("transaction-like-count")
>         .invoke("text")
>         .then((text) => {
>             const initialLikeCount = parseInt(text || "0");
> 
>             // Click the like button
>             cy.getBySel("transaction-like-button")
>                 .click();
> 
>             // Verify like count increased
>             cy.getBySel("transaction-like-count")
>                 .should("have.text", `${initialLikeCount + 1}`);
> 
>             // Verify like button state changed
>             cy.getBySel("transaction-like-button")
>                 .should("have.class", "liked");
>         });
> });
> ```
> 
> This implementation:
> 
> 1. Finds and clicks the first transaction in the personal feed
> 2. Waits for the transaction details to load
> 3. Gets the initial like count
> 4. Clicks the like button
> 5. Verifies the like count increased by 1
> 6. Verifies the like button state changed to indicate it's liked
> 
> The code uses the context (`ctx`) and interceptors that are already set up in the `beforeEach` block. It follows Cypress best practices by:
> 
> - Using data-test selectors (`getBySel`)
> - Waiting for network requests (`@getTransaction`)
> - Making assertions to verify the expected behavior
> - Chaining commands appropriately
> - Using meaningful variable names
> 
> This test should provide good coverage of the transaction liking functionality. The code assumes there are data-test attributes for:
> - `transaction-item`
> - `transaction-like-count`
> - `transaction-like-button`
> 
> If any of these selectors are different in your application, they would need to be adjusted accordingly.
