You are tasked with generating the code inside the 'it' blocks for a Cypress test suite. The test suite is for user sign-up and login functionality. You will be provided with the test suite structure and user information to use in your generated code.

Here is the Cypress test code structure:

<cypress_test_code>
import { User } from "../../../src/models";
import { isMobile } from "../../support/utils";
const apiGraphQL = `${Cypress.env("apiUrl")}/graphql`;
describe("User Sign-up and Login", function () {
    beforeEach(function () {
        cy.task("db:seed");
        cy.intercept("POST", "/users").as("signup");
        cy.intercept("POST", apiGraphQL, (req) => {
            const { body } = req;
            if (body.hasOwnProperty("operationName") && body.operationName === "CreateBankAccount") {
                req.alias = "gqlCreateBankAccountMutation";
            }
        });
    });
    it("should redirect to the home page after login", () => { });
});

</cypress_test_code>

And here is the user information to use in your tests:

<user_info>
{
  "userInfo": {
    "firstName": "Bob",
    "lastName": "Ross",
    "username": "PainterJoy90",
    "password": "s3cret"
  },
  "bankAccountInfo": {
    "bankName": "The Best Bank",
    "accountNumber": "123456789",
    "routingNumber": "987654321"
  },
  "loginCredentials": {
    "validPassword": "s3cret",
    "invalidUsername": "invalidUserName",
    "invalidPassword": "invalidPa$word",
    "anotherInvalidPassword": "INVALID"
  }
}
</user_info>

Your task is to generate the code inside each 'it' block so that the Cypress test runs and gets positive results. Follow these guidelines:

1. For each 'it' block, write Cypress commands that test the functionality described in the test name.
2. Use the provided user information (firstName, lastName, username, password) in your test commands where appropriate.
3. Ensure that your generated code follows Cypress best practices and conventions.
4. Include appropriate assertions to verify the expected behavior of each test.
5. If a test requires multiple steps, use comments to explain each step.
6. Do not modify the existing code structure or add new 'it' blocks.

When using the user information, refer to it as 'userInfo' followed by the property name, e.g., 'userInfo.firstName'.

If you encounter any scenarios where you need additional information that isn't provided, do not make assumptions. Instead, indicate that more information is needed for that specific test.

For error handling tests, use invalid data that is clearly different from the provided user information.

Place your generated code for each 'it' block within <generated_code> tags, and include the original 'it' block description as a comment before each block of generated code.

Begin generating the code for each 'it' block now.


> Copilot: Based on the test structure and user information provided, I'll generate the code for the "should redirect to the home page after login" test. Looking at the existing test patterns in your workspace, I can see how authentication and navigation work in this application.

> // should redirect to the home page after login
> it("should redirect to the home page after login", () => {
>     // Visit the signin page
>     cy.visit("/signin");
>     
>     // Enter valid login credentials

>     cy.getBySel("signin-submit").click();
>     
>     // Verify successful login by checking redirection to home page
>     cy.location("pathname").should("equal", "/");
>     
>     // Verify user is logged in by checking for user elements in the sidebar
>     cy.getBySel("sidenav-user-full-name").should("be.visible");
> });

> This test implementation:
> 
> 1. **Navigates to the signin page** - Uses `cy.visit("/signin")` to go to the login page
> 2. **Enters credentials** - Uses the provided `userInfo.username` and `userInfo.password` from the user information
> 3. **Submits the form** - Clicks the signin submit button
> 4. **Verifies redirection** - Checks that the user is redirected to the home page ("/")
> 5. **Confirms login state** - Verifies that user-specific elements are visible, indicating successful authentication
> 
> The test uses `getBySel()` helper function which is commonly used in this codebase for selecting elements by `data-test` attributes, as seen in the other test files in your workspace.
