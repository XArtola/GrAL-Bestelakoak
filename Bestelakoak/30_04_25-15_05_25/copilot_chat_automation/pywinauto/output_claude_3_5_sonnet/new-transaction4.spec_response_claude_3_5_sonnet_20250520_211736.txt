You are tasked with generating the code inside the 'it' blocks for a Cypress test suite. The test suite is for user sign-up and login functionality. You will be provided with the test suite structure and user information to use in your generated code.

Here is the Cypress test code structure:

<cypress_test_code>
import Dinero from "dinero.js";
import { User } from "../../../src/models";
import { isMobile } from "../../support/utils";
type NewTransactionTestCtx = {
    allUsers?: User[];
    user?: User;
    contact?: User;
};
describe("New Transaction", function () {
    const ctx: NewTransactionTestCtx = {};
    beforeEach(function () {
        cy.task("db:seed");
        cy.intercept("GET", "/users*").as("allUsers");
        cy.intercept("GET", "/users/search*").as("usersSearch");
        cy.intercept("POST", "/transactions").as("createTransaction");
        cy.intercept("GET", "/notifications").as("notifications");
        cy.intercept("GET", "/transactions/public").as("publicTransactions");
        cy.intercept("GET", "/transactions").as("personalTransactions");
        cy.intercept("PATCH", "/transactions/*").as("updateTransaction");
        cy.database("filter", "users").then((users: User[]) => {
            ctx.allUsers = users;
            ctx.user = users[0];
            ctx.contact = users[1];
            return cy.loginByXstate(ctx.user.username);
        });
    });
    it("submits a transaction payment and verifies the deposit for the receiver", () => { });
});

</cypress_test_code>

And here is the user information to use in your tests:

<user_info>
{
  "paymentTransactions": [
    {
      "amount": "35",
      "description": "Sushi dinner üç£"
    },
    {
      "amount": 25,
      "description": "Indian Food"
    }
  ],
  "requestTransactions": [
    {
      "amount": "95",
      "description": "Fancy Hotel üè®"
    },
    {
      "amount": 100,
      "description": "Fancy Hotel"
    }
  ]
}
</user_info>

Your task is to generate the code inside each 'it' block so that the Cypress test runs and gets positive results. Follow these guidelines:

1. For each 'it' block, write Cypress commands that test the functionality described in the test name.
2. Use the provided user information (firstName, lastName, username, password) in your test commands where appropriate.
3. Ensure that your generated code follows Cypress best practices and conventions.
4. Include appropriate assertions to verify the expected behavior of each test.
5. If a test requires multiple steps, use comments to explain each step.
6. Do not modify the existing code structure or add new 'it' blocks.

When using the user information, refer to it as 'userInfo' followed by the property name, e.g., 'userInfo.firstName'.

If you encounter any scenarios where you need additional information that isn't provided, do not make assumptions. Instead, indicate that more information is needed for that specific test.

For error handling tests, use invalid data that is clearly different from the provided user information.

Place your generated code for each 'it' block within <generated_code> tags, and include the original 'it' block description as a comment before each block of generated code.

Begin generating the code for each 'it' block now.


> Copilot: I'll help you generate the code for the test case. Based on the test description and user information provided, here's the implementation for the 'it' block:
> 
> ```typescript
> // Test: submits a transaction payment and verifies the deposit for the receiver
> it("submits a transaction payment and verifies the deposit for the receiver", () => {
>     // Store initial receiver balance for later comparison
>     let receiverInitialBalance: number;
>     cy.database("find", "users", { id: ctx.contact!.id }).then((user) => {
>         receiverInitialBalance = user.balance;
>     });
> 
>     // Navigate to new transaction form
>     cy.getBySel("new-transaction").click();
>     cy.wait("@allUsers");
> 
>     // Search for the contact
>     cy.getBySel("user-list-search-input").type(ctx.contact!.firstName);
>     cy.wait("@usersSearch");
> 
>     // Select the contact from search results
>     cy.getBySel("user-list-item").first().click();
> 
>     // Enter payment details using test data
>     cy.getBySel("amount-input").type("35");
>     cy.getBySel("transaction-create-description-input").type("Sushi dinner üç£");
> 
>     // Submit payment
>     cy.getBySel("transaction-create-submit-payment").click();
>     cy.wait("@createTransaction");
> 
>     // Verify transaction appears in list
>     cy.getBySel("transaction-list").should("be.visible");
>     cy.getBySel("transaction-item")
>         .first()
>         .should("contain", "Sushi dinner üç£")
>         .and("contain", "$35");
> 
>     // Switch to receiver's account to verify deposit
>     cy.switchUserByXstate(ctx.contact!.username);
> 
>     // Navigate to personal transactions
>     cy.getBySel("nav-personal-tab").click();
>     cy.wait("@personalTransactions");
> 
>     // Verify the transaction appears in receiver's list
>     cy.getBySel("transaction-item")
>         .first()
>         .should("contain", "Sushi dinner üç£")
>         .and("contain", "$35")
>         .and("contain", "received");
> 
>     // Verify receiver's balance increased by payment amount
>     cy.database("find", "users", { id: ctx.contact!.id }).then((user) => {
>         const expectedBalance = receiverInitialBalance + 3500; // $35.00 in cents
>         expect(user.balance).to.equal(expectedBalance);
>     });
> });
> ```
> 
> This implementation:
> 
> 1. Stores the receiver's initial balance for comparison
> 2. Navigates to the new transaction form
> 3. Searches for and selects the contact
> 4. Enters payment information using the first payment transaction from the test data
> 5. Submits the payment
> 6. Verifies the transaction appears in the sender's list
> 7. Switches to the receiver's account
> 8. Verifies the transaction appears in the receiver's list
> 9. Confirms the receiver's balance increased by the correct amount
> 
> The code uses data selectors (getBySel) which are assumed to be custom Cypress commands defined elsewhere in the test suite. It also uses standard Cypress commands for interacting with elements and making assertions.
> 
> The implementation follows Cypress best practices by:
> - Waiting for network requests to complete using aliases
> - Making meaningful assertions at each step
> - Using appropriate selectors
> - Including clear comments explaining each step
> - Properly handling asynchronous operations
> 
> The amounts are handled in cents internally (multiplied by 100) since that's a common practice for financial transactions to avoid floating-point precision issues.
