#file:cypress-realworld-app 
You are tasked with generating the code inside the 'it' blocks for a Cypress test suite. The test suite is for user sign-up and login functionality. You will be provided with the test suite structure and user information to use in your generated code.

Here is the Cypress test code structure:

<cypress_test_code>
import { User, Transaction } from "../../../src/models";
type NewTransactionCtx = {
    transactionRequest?: Transaction;
    authenticatedUser?: User;
};
describe("Transaction View", function () {
    const ctx: NewTransactionCtx = {};
    beforeEach(function () {
        cy.task("db:seed");
        cy.intercept("GET", "/transactions*").as("personalTransactions");
        cy.intercept("GET", "/transactions/public*").as("publicTransactions");
        cy.intercept("GET", "/transactions/*").as("getTransaction");
        cy.intercept("PATCH", "/transactions/*").as("updateTransaction");
        cy.intercept("GET", "/checkAuth").as("userProfile");
        cy.intercept("GET", "/notifications").as("getNotifications");
        cy.intercept("GET", "/bankAccounts").as("getBankAccounts");
        cy.database("find", "users").then((user: User) => {
            ctx.authenticatedUser = user;
            cy.loginByXstate(ctx.authenticatedUser.username);
            cy.database("find", "transactions", {
                receiverId: ctx.authenticatedUser.id,
                status: "pending",
                requestStatus: "pending",
                requestResolvedAt: "",
            }).then((transaction: Transaction) => {
                ctx.transactionRequest = transaction;
            });
        });
        cy.getBySel("nav-personal-tab").click();
        cy.wait("@personalTransactions");
    });
    it("does not display accept/reject buttons on completed request", () => { });
});

</cypress_test_code>

And here is the user information to use in your tests:

<user_info>
{}
</user_info>

Your task is to generate the code inside each 'it' block so that the Cypress test runs and gets positive results. Follow these guidelines:

1. For each 'it' block, write Cypress commands that test the functionality described in the test name.
2. Use the provided user information (firstName, lastName, username, password) in your test commands where appropriate.
3. Ensure that your generated code follows Cypress best practices and conventions.
4. Include appropriate assertions to verify the expected behavior of each test.
5. If a test requires multiple steps, use comments to explain each step.
6. Do not modify the existing code structure or add new 'it' blocks.

When using the user information, refer to it as 'userInfo' followed by the property name, e.g., 'userInfo.firstName'.

If you encounter any scenarios where you need additional information that isn't provided, do not make assumptions. Instead, indicate that more information is needed for that specific test.

For error handling tests, use invalid data that is clearly different from the provided user information.

Place your generated code for each 'it' block within <generated_code> tags, and include the original 'it' block description as a comment before each block of generated code.

Begin generating the code for each 'it' block now.


> Copilot: I'll help you generate the code for the test case in the Transaction View test suite. Let me analyze the test description and provide appropriate code.
> 
> The test "does not display accept/reject buttons on completed request" should verify that once a transaction request is completed, the accept/reject action buttons are no longer visible.
> 
> Here's the generated code:
> 
> ```typescript
> // Test: does not display accept/reject buttons on completed request
> it("does not display accept/reject buttons on completed request", () => {
>     // Verify we have a transaction request in context
>     expect(ctx.transactionRequest).to.exist;
>     
>     // Click on the first transaction item
>     cy.getBySel("transaction-item").first().click();
>     cy.wait("@getTransaction");
>     
>     // Update transaction status to completed
>     cy.database("update", "transactions", {
>         id: ctx.transactionRequest!.id,
>         status: "complete",
>         requestStatus: "accepted",
>         requestResolvedAt: new Date().toISOString()
>     });
>     
>     // Refresh the page to see updated transaction
>     cy.reload();
>     cy.wait("@getTransaction");
>     
>     // Verify the accept button is not present
>     cy.getBySel("transaction-accept-request")
>         .should("not.exist");
>     
>     // Verify the reject button is not present    
>     cy.getBySel("transaction-reject-request")
>         .should("not.exist");
>         
>     // Verify transaction shows completed status
>     cy.getBySel("transaction-payment-status")
>         .should("contain", "Complete");
> });
> ```
> 
> This test:
> 1. Verifies that we have a transaction request in the test context
> 2. Opens the first transaction from the list
> 3. Updates the transaction status to completed in the database
> 4. Reloads the page to show the updated state
> 5. Verifies that neither accept nor reject buttons are present
> 6. Confirms the transaction shows as completed
> 
> The code uses the test context (ctx) that's set up in the beforeEach block and follows Cypress best practices for:
> - Waiting for network requests
> - Using data-test selectors (getBySel)
> - Making assertions about element presence/absence
> - Checking visible state changes
> 
> Since the test context already provides an authenticated user and transaction data through the beforeEach block, we don't need the userInfo data in this particular test case.
