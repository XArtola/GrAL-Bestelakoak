You are tasked with generating the code inside the 'it' blocks for a Cypress test suite. The test suite is for user sign-up and login functionality. You will be provided with the test suite structure and user information to use in your generated code.

Here is the Cypress test code structure:

<cypress_test_code>
import { isMobile } from "../../support/utils";
import { User, Transaction } from "../../../src/models";
type NotificationsCtx = {
    userA: User;
    userB: User;
    userC: User;
};
describe("Notifications", function () {
    const ctx = {} as NotificationsCtx;
    beforeEach(function () {
        cy.task("db:seed");
        cy.intercept("GET", "/notifications*").as("getNotifications");
        cy.intercept("POST", "/transactions").as("createTransaction");
        cy.intercept("PATCH", "/notifications/*").as("updateNotification");
        cy.intercept("POST", "/comments/*").as("postComment");
        cy.database("filter", "users").then((users: User[]) => {
            ctx.userA = users[0];
            ctx.userB = users[1];
            ctx.userC = users[2];
        });
    });
    describe("notifications from user interactions", function () {
        it("User A sends a payment to User B", () => { });
    });
});

</cypress_test_code>

And here is the user information to use in your tests:

<user_info>
{}
</user_info>

Your task is to generate the code inside each 'it' block so that the Cypress test runs and gets positive results. Follow these guidelines:

1. For each 'it' block, write Cypress commands that test the functionality described in the test name.
2. Use the provided user information (firstName, lastName, username, password) in your test commands where appropriate.
3. Ensure that your generated code follows Cypress best practices and conventions.
4. Include appropriate assertions to verify the expected behavior of each test.
5. If a test requires multiple steps, use comments to explain each step.
6. Do not modify the existing code structure or add new 'it' blocks.

When using the user information, refer to it as 'userInfo' followed by the property name, e.g., 'userInfo.firstName'.

If you encounter any scenarios where you need additional information that isn't provided, do not make assumptions. Instead, indicate that more information is needed for that specific test.

For error handling tests, use invalid data that is clearly different from the provided user information.

Place your generated code for each 'it' block within <generated_code> tags, and include the original 'it' block description as a comment before each block of generated code.

Begin generating the code for each 'it' block now.


> Copilot: # Implementing Cypress Notification Test for Payment Flow
> 
> Looking at the test you need implemented, I'll create the code for the "User A sends a payment to User B" test block. This test will verify that when one user sends a payment to another, the recipient receives a notification.
> 
> Here's the implementation for the specified test:
> 
> ```typescript
> // User A sends a payment to User B
> it("User A sends a payment to User B", () => {
>     <generated_code>
>     // Login as User A
>     cy.loginByXstate(ctx.userA.username);
>     
>     // Create a new payment transaction to User B
>     cy.getBySel("nav-top-new-transaction").click();
>     cy.getBySel("user-list-search-input").type(ctx.userB.firstName);
>     cy.getBySel("user-list-item").first().click();
>     
>     // Enter payment amount and description
>     cy.getBySel("amount-input").type("50");
>     cy.getBySel("transaction-create-description-input").type("Payment from A to B");
>     cy.getBySel("transaction-create-submit-payment").click();
>     
>     // Wait for transaction to be created
>     cy.wait("@createTransaction");
>     
>     // Log out User A
>     cy.getBySel("sidenav-signout").click();
>     
>     // Login as User B
>     cy.loginByXstate(ctx.userB.username);
>     cy.wait("@getNotifications");
>     
>     // Check for notifications
>     cy.getBySel("nav-top-notifications-count").should("be.visible");
>     cy.getBySel("nav-top-notifications-button").click();
>     
>     // Verify the notification content
>     cy.getBySel("notification-list-item")
>         .first()
>         .should("contain", ctx.userA.firstName)
>         .and("contain", "paid you");
>     </generated_code>
> });
> ```
> 
> This implementation:
> 1. Logs in as User A
> 2. Initiates a new transaction to User B
> 3. Completes the payment with an amount and description
> 4. Logs out as User A
> 5. Logs in as User B
> 6. Checks that a notification badge is visible
> 7. Opens the notifications panel
> 8. Verifies the notification contains User A's name and indicates a payment was made
> 
> The test uses the user context setup in the beforeEach block, so no additional user information was needed from the empty user_info object.
