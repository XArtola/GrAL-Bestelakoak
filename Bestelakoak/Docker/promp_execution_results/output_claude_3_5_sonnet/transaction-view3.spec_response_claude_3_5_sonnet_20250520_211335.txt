#file:cypress-realworld-app 
You are tasked with generating the code inside the 'it' blocks for a Cypress test suite. The test suite is for user sign-up and login functionality. You will be provided with the test suite structure and user information to use in your generated code.

Here is the Cypress test code structure:

<cypress_test_code>
import { User, Transaction } from "../../../src/models";
type NewTransactionCtx = {
    transactionRequest?: Transaction;
    authenticatedUser?: User;
};
describe("Transaction View", function () {
    const ctx: NewTransactionCtx = {};
    beforeEach(function () {
        cy.task("db:seed");
        cy.intercept("GET", "/transactions*").as("personalTransactions");
        cy.intercept("GET", "/transactions/public*").as("publicTransactions");
        cy.intercept("GET", "/transactions/*").as("getTransaction");
        cy.intercept("PATCH", "/transactions/*").as("updateTransaction");
        cy.intercept("GET", "/checkAuth").as("userProfile");
        cy.intercept("GET", "/notifications").as("getNotifications");
        cy.intercept("GET", "/bankAccounts").as("getBankAccounts");
        cy.database("find", "users").then((user: User) => {
            ctx.authenticatedUser = user;
            cy.loginByXstate(ctx.authenticatedUser.username);
            cy.database("find", "transactions", {
                receiverId: ctx.authenticatedUser.id,
                status: "pending",
                requestStatus: "pending",
                requestResolvedAt: "",
            }).then((transaction: Transaction) => {
                ctx.transactionRequest = transaction;
            });
        });
        cy.getBySel("nav-personal-tab").click();
        cy.wait("@personalTransactions");
    });
    it("comments on a transaction", () => { });
});

</cypress_test_code>

And here is the user information to use in your tests:

<user_info>
{}
</user_info>

Your task is to generate the code inside each 'it' block so that the Cypress test runs and gets positive results. Follow these guidelines:

1. For each 'it' block, write Cypress commands that test the functionality described in the test name.
2. Use the provided user information (firstName, lastName, username, password) in your test commands where appropriate.
3. Ensure that your generated code follows Cypress best practices and conventions.
4. Include appropriate assertions to verify the expected behavior of each test.
5. If a test requires multiple steps, use comments to explain each step.
6. Do not modify the existing code structure or add new 'it' blocks.

When using the user information, refer to it as 'userInfo' followed by the property name, e.g., 'userInfo.firstName'.

If you encounter any scenarios where you need additional information that isn't provided, do not make assumptions. Instead, indicate that more information is needed for that specific test.

For error handling tests, use invalid data that is clearly different from the provided user information.

Place your generated code for each 'it' block within <generated_code> tags, and include the original 'it' block description as a comment before each block of generated code.

Begin generating the code for each 'it' block now.


> Copilot: I'll help generate the code for the `it` block in the transaction view test suite. Based on the test name "comments on a transaction" and the setup code, this test should verify the ability to add comments to a transaction.
> 
> Here's the implementation:
> 
> ```typescript
> // Test: comments on a transaction
> it("comments on a transaction", () => {
>     // Verify we have a transaction request in context
>     if (!ctx.transactionRequest) {
>         throw new Error("No transaction request found in context");
>     }
> 
>     // Navigate to the transaction detail view
>     cy.visit(`/transaction/${ctx.transactionRequest.id}`);
>     cy.wait("@getTransaction");
> 
>     // Get the comment input field
>     cy.getBySel("transaction-comment-input")
>         .should("be.visible")
>         .type("Great dinner! Thanks!");
> 
>     // Submit the comment
>     cy.getBySel("transaction-comment-submit")
>         .should("be.visible")
>         .click();
> 
>     // Wait for the comment to be posted
>     cy.wait("@postComment");
> 
>     // Verify the comment appears in the transaction
>     cy.getBySel("comments-list")
>         .should("be.visible")
>         .and("contain", "Great dinner! Thanks!");
> 
>     // Verify comment author is the authenticated user
>     cy.getBySel("comment-author")
>         .first()
>         .should("contain", ctx.authenticatedUser?.firstName)
>         .and("contain", ctx.authenticatedUser?.lastName);
> 
>     // Verify timestamp is present
>     cy.getBySel("comment-timestamp")
>         .first()
>         .should("be.visible");
> });
> ```
> 
> This implementation:
> 
> 1. First checks that we have a transaction request to work with from the context
> 2. Navigates to the specific transaction's detail view
> 3. Enters a comment in the comment input field
> 4. Submits the comment
> 5. Verifies the comment was posted successfully
> 6. Checks that the comment appears with correct author information
> 7. Verifies the timestamp is present
> 
> The code assumes:
> - A `postComment` network intercept is set up (which should be added to the beforeEach block)
> - The existence of certain data-test selectors (like "transaction-comment-input", "comments-list", etc.)
> - The ability to navigate to a transaction detail view using the transaction ID
> 
> Note: You may want to add the following intercept to the beforeEach block:
> ```typescript
> cy.intercept("POST", "/comments/*").as("postComment");
> ```
> 
> If any of these assumptions are incorrect or if different selectors are used in the application, the test code would need to be adjusted accordingly.
