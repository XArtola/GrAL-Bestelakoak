You are tasked with generating the code inside the 'it' blocks for a Cypress test suite. The test suite is for user sign-up and login functionality. You will be provided with the test suite structure and user information to use in your generated code.

Here is the Cypress test code structure:

<cypress_test_code>
import { isMobile } from "../../support/utils";
import { User, Transaction } from "../../../src/models";
type NotificationsCtx = {
    userA: User;
    userB: User;
    userC: User;
};
describe("Notifications", function () {
    const ctx = {} as NotificationsCtx;
    beforeEach(function () {
        cy.task("db:seed");
        cy.intercept("GET", "/notifications*").as("getNotifications");
        cy.intercept("POST", "/transactions").as("createTransaction");
        cy.intercept("PATCH", "/notifications/*").as("updateNotification");
        cy.intercept("POST", "/comments/*").as("postComment");
        cy.database("filter", "users").then((users: User[]) => {
            ctx.userA = users[0];
            ctx.userB = users[1];
            ctx.userC = users[2];
        });
    });
    describe("notifications from user interactions", function () {
        it("User C likes a transaction between User A and User B; User A and User B get notifications that User C liked transaction", () => { });
    });
});

</cypress_test_code>

And here is the user information to use in your tests:

<user_info>
{}
</user_info>

Your task is to generate the code inside each 'it' block so that the Cypress test runs and gets positive results. Follow these guidelines:

1. For each 'it' block, write Cypress commands that test the functionality described in the test name.
2. Use the provided user information (firstName, lastName, username, password) in your test commands where appropriate.
3. Ensure that your generated code follows Cypress best practices and conventions.
4. Include appropriate assertions to verify the expected behavior of each test.
5. If a test requires multiple steps, use comments to explain each step.
6. Do not modify the existing code structure or add new 'it' blocks.

When using the user information, refer to it as 'userInfo' followed by the property name, e.g., 'userInfo.firstName'.

If you encounter any scenarios where you need additional information that isn't provided, do not make assumptions. Instead, indicate that more information is needed for that specific test.

For error handling tests, use invalid data that is clearly different from the provided user information.

Place your generated code for each 'it' block within <generated_code> tags, and include the original 'it' block description as a comment before each block of generated code.

Begin generating the code for each 'it' block now.


> Copilot: I'll help you generate the code for the provided notification test case. Based on the test description and context setup, here's the implementation:
> 
> ```typescript
> // Test: User C likes a transaction between User A and User B; User A and B get notifications that User C liked transaction
> it("User C likes a transaction between User A and User B; User A and B get notifications that User C liked transaction", () => {
>     // Find a transaction between User A and User B
>     cy.database("find", "transactions", { 
>         senderId: ctx.userA.id, 
>         receiverId: ctx.userB.id 
>     }).then((transaction: Transaction) => {
>         // Login as User C
>         cy.loginByXstate(ctx.userC.username);
>         
>         // Visit the transaction detail page
>         cy.visit(`/transaction/${transaction.id}`);
>         
>         // Like the transaction
>         cy.getBySelLike("like-button").click();
>         cy.wait("@postLike");
> 
>         // Check User A's notifications
>         cy.switchUser(ctx.userA.username);
>         cy.visit("/");
>         cy.wait("@getNotifications");
>         cy.getBySel("nav-top-notifications-count").should("contain", "1");
>         cy.getBySel("nav-top-notifications-link").click();
>         cy.getBySelLike("notification-list-item")
>             .first()
>             .should("contain", `${ctx.userC.firstName} ${ctx.userC.lastName} liked your transaction`);
> 
>         // Check User B's notifications
>         cy.switchUser(ctx.userB.username);
>         cy.visit("/");
>         cy.wait("@getNotifications");
>         cy.getBySel("nav-top-notifications-count").should("contain", "1");
>         cy.getBySel("nav-top-notifications-link").click();
>         cy.getBySelLike("notification-list-item")
>             .first()
>             .should("contain", `${ctx.userC.firstName} ${ctx.userC.lastName} liked your transaction`);
>     });
> });
> ```
> 
> This test implementation:
> 
> 1. Finds a transaction between User A and User B using the database helper
> 2. Logs in as User C to like the transaction
> 3. Visits the transaction page and clicks the like button
> 4. Switches to User A to verify they received a notification
> 5. Switches to User B to verify they also received a notification
> 6. Uses appropriate assertions to verify notification content and count
> 7. Waits for necessary API calls using interceptors defined in beforeEach
> 
> The code uses custom Cypress commands that appear to be defined in the application:
> - `loginByXstate`
> - `switchUser` 
> - `getBySel`
> - `getBySelLike`
> 
> The test follows Cypress best practices by:
> - Using chain-able commands
> - Making appropriate assertions
> - Waiting for network requests
> - Using data-test attributes for element selection
> - Following a clear logical flow of actions
> 
> Let me know if you need any clarification or have questions about the implementation.
