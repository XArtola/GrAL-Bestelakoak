You are tasked with generating the code inside the 'it' blocks for a Cypress test suite. The test suite is for user sign-up and login functionality. You will be provided with the test suite structure and user information to use in your generated code.

Here is the Cypress test code structure:

<cypress_test_code>
import { User } from "../../../src/models";
import { isMobile } from "../../support/utils";
const apiGraphQL = `${Cypress.env("apiUrl")}/graphql`;
describe("User Sign-up and Login", function () {
    beforeEach(function () {
        cy.task("db:seed");
        cy.intercept("POST", "/users").as("signup");
        cy.intercept("POST", apiGraphQL, (req) => {
            const { body } = req;
            if (body.hasOwnProperty("operationName") && body.operationName === "CreateBankAccount") {
                req.alias = "gqlCreateBankAccountMutation";
            }
        });
    });
    it("should redirect unauthenticated user to signin page", () => { });
});

</cypress_test_code>

And here is the user information to use in your tests:

<user_info>
{
  "userInfo": {
    "firstName": "Bob",
    "lastName": "Ross",
    "username": "PainterJoy90",
    "password": "s3cret"
  },
  "bankAccountInfo": {
    "bankName": "The Best Bank",
    "accountNumber": "123456789",
    "routingNumber": "987654321"
  },
  "loginCredentials": {
    "validPassword": "s3cret",
    "invalidUsername": "invalidUserName",
    "invalidPassword": "invalidPa$word",
    "anotherInvalidPassword": "INVALID"
  }
}
</user_info>

Your task is to generate the code inside each 'it' block so that the Cypress test runs and gets positive results. Follow these guidelines:

1. For each 'it' block, write Cypress commands that test the functionality described in the test name.
2. Use the provided user information (firstName, lastName, username, password) in your test commands where appropriate.
3. Ensure that your generated code follows Cypress best practices and conventions.
4. Include appropriate assertions to verify the expected behavior of each test.
5. If a test requires multiple steps, use comments to explain each step.
6. Do not modify the existing code structure or add new 'it' blocks.

When using the user information, refer to it as 'userInfo' followed by the property name, e.g., 'userInfo.firstName'.

If you encounter any scenarios where you need additional information that isn't provided, do not make assumptions. Instead, indicate that more information is needed for that specific test.

For error handling tests, use invalid data that is clearly different from the provided user information.

Place your generated code for each 'it' block within <generated_code> tags, and include the original 'it' block description as a comment before each block of generated code.

Begin generating the code for each 'it' block now.


> Copilot: I'll help you generate the code for the test case. Looking at the test description and user information provided, here's the implementation for the "should redirect unauthenticated user to signin page" test:
> 
> ```typescript
> // Test: Redirect unauthenticated user to signin page
> // This test verifies that unauthorized users are redirected to the signin page
> it("should redirect unauthenticated user to signin page", () => {
>     // Visit a protected page
>     cy.visit("/personal");
>     
>     // Verify redirect to the signin page
>     cy.location("pathname").should("equal", "/signin");
>     
>     // Verify signin page elements are visible
>     cy.getBySel("signin-title").should("be.visible");
> });
> ```
> 
> This test implements the following logic:
> 
> 1. Attempts to access a protected page ("/personal") without authentication
> 2. Verifies that the user is redirected to the signin page
> 3. Checks that signin page elements are visible
> 
> The test follows Cypress best practices by:
> - Using cy.location() to verify URL paths
> - Using data-test attributes (getBySel) for element selection
> - Making assertions with should()
> - Keeping commands simple and readable
> 
> The test doesn't require the user information since it's testing unauthenticated access, but it uses the application's routing and authentication behavior to verify proper redirection.
> 
> This implementation assumes:
> 1. Protected routes redirect to "/signin"
> 2. The signin page has an element with data-test="signin-title"
> 3. The application handles unauthenticated requests by redirecting
> 
> Let me know if you would like me to explain any part of the implementation or if you need modifications to better match your application's behavior.
