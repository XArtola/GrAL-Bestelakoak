#file:cypress-realworld-app 
You are tasked with generating the code inside the 'it' blocks for a Cypress test suite. The test suite is for user sign-up and login functionality. You will be provided with the test suite structure and user information to use in your generated code.

Here is the Cypress test code structure:

<cypress_test_code>
import { User, Transaction } from "../../../src/models";
type NewTransactionCtx = {
    transactionRequest?: Transaction;
    authenticatedUser?: User;
};
describe("Transaction View", function () {
    const ctx: NewTransactionCtx = {};
    beforeEach(function () {
        cy.task("db:seed");
        cy.intercept("GET", "/transactions*").as("personalTransactions");
        cy.intercept("GET", "/transactions/public*").as("publicTransactions");
        cy.intercept("GET", "/transactions/*").as("getTransaction");
        cy.intercept("PATCH", "/transactions/*").as("updateTransaction");
        cy.intercept("GET", "/checkAuth").as("userProfile");
        cy.intercept("GET", "/notifications").as("getNotifications");
        cy.intercept("GET", "/bankAccounts").as("getBankAccounts");
        cy.database("find", "users").then((user: User) => {
            ctx.authenticatedUser = user;
            cy.loginByXstate(ctx.authenticatedUser.username);
            cy.database("find", "transactions", {
                receiverId: ctx.authenticatedUser.id,
                status: "pending",
                requestStatus: "pending",
                requestResolvedAt: "",
            }).then((transaction: Transaction) => {
                ctx.transactionRequest = transaction;
            });
        });
        cy.getBySel("nav-personal-tab").click();
        cy.wait("@personalTransactions");
    });
    it("does not display accept/reject buttons on completed request", () => { });
});

</cypress_test_code>

And here is the user information to use in your tests:

<user_info>
{}
</user_info>

Your task is to generate the code inside each 'it' block so that the Cypress test runs and gets positive results. Follow these guidelines:

1. For each 'it' block, write Cypress commands that test the functionality described in the test name.
2. Use the provided user information (firstName, lastName, username, password) in your test commands where appropriate.
3. Ensure that your generated code follows Cypress best practices and conventions.
4. Include appropriate assertions to verify the expected behavior of each test.
5. If a test requires multiple steps, use comments to explain each step.
6. Do not modify the existing code structure or add new 'it' blocks.

When using the user information, refer to it as 'userInfo' followed by the property name, e.g., 'userInfo.firstName'.

If you encounter any scenarios where you need additional information that isn't provided, do not make assumptions. Instead, indicate that more information is needed for that specific test.

For error handling tests, use invalid data that is clearly different from the provided user information.

Place your generated code for each 'it' block within <generated_code> tags, and include the original 'it' block description as a comment before each block of generated code.

Begin generating the code for each 'it' block now.


> Copilot: Looking at the test structure, I can see this is a transaction view test that checks if accept/reject buttons are properly hidden on completed requests. Based on the context and similar test files in the workspace, here's the generated code:
> 
> <generated_code>
> // does not display accept/reject buttons on completed request
> it("does not display accept/reject buttons on completed request", () => {
>     // Find a completed transaction in the personal transactions list
>     cy.getBySel("transaction-item")
>         .should("be.visible")
>         .first()
>         .click();
>     
>     // Wait for transaction details to load
>     cy.wait("@getTransaction");
>     
>     // Verify that the transaction view is displayed
>     cy.getBySel("transaction-detail-header").should("be.visible");
>     
>     // Check that accept/reject buttons are not present for completed transactions
>     cy.getBySel("transaction-accept-request").should("not.exist");
>     cy.getBySel("transaction-reject-request").should("not.exist");
>     
>     // Verify that the transaction status shows as complete or settled
>     cy.getBySel("transaction-status")
>         .should("be.visible")
>         .and("not.contain", "pending");
> });
> </generated_code>
> 
> The test verifies that when viewing a completed transaction, the accept and reject buttons are not displayed, which is the expected behavior since these actions are only relevant for pending transaction requests.
