You are tasked with generating the code inside the 'it' blocks for a Cypress test suite. The test suite is for user sign-up and login functionality. You will be provided with the test suite structure and user information to use in your generated code.

Here is the Cypress test code structure:

<cypress_test_code>
import { User } from "../../../src/models";
import { isMobile } from "../../support/utils";
const apiGraphQL = `${Cypress.env("apiUrl")}/graphql`;
describe("User Sign-up and Login", function () {
    beforeEach(function () {
        cy.task("db:seed");
        cy.intercept("POST", "/users").as("signup");
        cy.intercept("POST", apiGraphQL, (req) => {
            const { body } = req;
            if (body.hasOwnProperty("operationName") && body.operationName === "CreateBankAccount") {
                req.alias = "gqlCreateBankAccountMutation";
            }
        });
    });
    it("should redirect unauthenticated user to signin page", () => { });
});

</cypress_test_code>

And here is the user information to use in your tests:

<user_info>
{
  "userInfo": {
    "firstName": "Bob",
    "lastName": "Ross",
    "username": "PainterJoy90",
    "password": "s3cret"
  },
  "bankAccountInfo": {
    "bankName": "The Best Bank",
    "accountNumber": "123456789",
    "routingNumber": "987654321"
  },
  "loginCredentials": {
    "validPassword": "s3cret",
    "invalidUsername": "invalidUserName",
    "invalidPassword": "invalidPa$word",
    "anotherInvalidPassword": "INVALID"
  }
}
</user_info>

Your task is to generate the code inside each 'it' block so that the Cypress test runs and gets positive results. Follow these guidelines:

1. For each 'it' block, write Cypress commands that test the functionality described in the test name.
2. Use the provided user information (firstName, lastName, username, password) in your test commands where appropriate.
3. Ensure that your generated code follows Cypress best practices and conventions.
4. Include appropriate assertions to verify the expected behavior of each test.
5. If a test requires multiple steps, use comments to explain each step.
6. Do not modify the existing code structure or add new 'it' blocks.

When using the user information, refer to it as 'userInfo' followed by the property name, e.g., 'userInfo.firstName'.

If you encounter any scenarios where you need additional information that isn't provided, do not make assumptions. Instead, indicate that more information is needed for that specific test.

For error handling tests, use invalid data that is clearly different from the provided user information.

Place your generated code for each 'it' block within <generated_code> tags, and include the original 'it' block description as a comment before each block of generated code.

Begin generating the code for each 'it' block now.


> Copilot: # Cypress Test Code for User Sign-up and Login
> 
> I'll implement the code for the single `it` block in your test suite. This test verifies that unauthenticated users are redirected to the signin page when attempting to access protected routes.
> 
> ```typescript
> it("should redirect unauthenticated user to signin page", () => {
>     // Try to access a protected page without authentication
>     cy.visit("/personal");
>     
>     // Verify we're redirected to the signin page
>     cy.location("pathname").should("equal", "/signin");
>     
>     // Verify signin page elements are visible
>     cy.getBySel("signin-title").should("be.visible");
> });
> ```
> 
> Based on the test files in your workspace, the app correctly redirects unauthenticated users to the `/signin` path when they try to access protected routes. The test visits a protected route (`/personal`), checks that the URL pathname equals `/signin`, and verifies that the signin page title element is visible.
> 
> This implementation follows Cypress best practices by:
> 1. Using clear, concise commands
> 2. Including specific assertions to verify the expected behavior
> 3. Adding comments to explain each step
> 4. Using the `getBySel` custom command that selects elements by data-test attributes
> 
> The test doesn't require the user information provided since it's only checking the redirection behavior for unauthenticated users.
