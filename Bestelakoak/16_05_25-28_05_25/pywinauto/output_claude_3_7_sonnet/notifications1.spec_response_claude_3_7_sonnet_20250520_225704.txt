You are tasked with generating the code inside the 'it' blocks for a Cypress test suite. The test suite is for user sign-up and login functionality. You will be provided with the test suite structure and user information to use in your generated code.

Here is the Cypress test code structure:

<cypress_test_code>
import { isMobile } from "../../support/utils";
import { User, Transaction } from "../../../src/models";
type NotificationsCtx = {
    userA: User;
    userB: User;
    userC: User;
};
describe("Notifications", function () {
    const ctx = {} as NotificationsCtx;
    beforeEach(function () {
        cy.task("db:seed");
        cy.intercept("GET", "/notifications*").as("getNotifications");
        cy.intercept("POST", "/transactions").as("createTransaction");
        cy.intercept("PATCH", "/notifications/*").as("updateNotification");
        cy.intercept("POST", "/comments/*").as("postComment");
        cy.database("filter", "users").then((users: User[]) => {
            ctx.userA = users[0];
            ctx.userB = users[1];
            ctx.userC = users[2];
        });
    });
    describe("notifications from user interactions", function () {
        it("User A likes a transaction of User B; User B gets notification that User A liked transaction ", () => { });
    });
});

</cypress_test_code>

And here is the user information to use in your tests:

<user_info>
{}
</user_info>

Your task is to generate the code inside each 'it' block so that the Cypress test runs and gets positive results. Follow these guidelines:

1. For each 'it' block, write Cypress commands that test the functionality described in the test name.
2. Use the provided user information (firstName, lastName, username, password) in your test commands where appropriate.
3. Ensure that your generated code follows Cypress best practices and conventions.
4. Include appropriate assertions to verify the expected behavior of each test.
5. If a test requires multiple steps, use comments to explain each step.
6. Do not modify the existing code structure or add new 'it' blocks.

When using the user information, refer to it as 'userInfo' followed by the property name, e.g., 'userInfo.firstName'.

If you encounter any scenarios where you need additional information that isn't provided, do not make assumptions. Instead, indicate that more information is needed for that specific test.

For error handling tests, use invalid data that is clearly different from the provided user information.

Place your generated code for each 'it' block within <generated_code> tags, and include the original 'it' block description as a comment before each block of generated code.

Begin generating the code for each 'it' block now.


> Copilot: Looking at the test description, I need to implement a Cypress test that verifies notification functionality when one user likes another user's transaction.
> 
> For this test, I'll:
> 1. Login as User A
> 2. Find and like a transaction created by User B
> 3. Log out as User A and log in as User B
> 4. Check if User B receives a notification about User A's like
> 
> Here's the implementation:
> 
> ```typescript
> // User A likes a transaction of User B; User B gets notification that User A liked transaction
> it("User A likes a transaction of User B; User B gets notification that User A liked transaction ", () => {
>     // Login as User B first to create a transaction
>     cy.loginByXstate(ctx.userB.username);
>     
>     // Create a transaction that User A will later like
>     cy.getBySel("new-transaction").click();
>     cy.getBySel("user-list-search-input").type(ctx.userA.firstName);
>     cy.getBySel("user-list-item").first().click();
>     cy.getBySel("amount-input").type("50");
>     cy.getBySel("transaction-create-description-input").type("Test transaction for like");
>     cy.getBySel("transaction-create-submit-payment").click();
>     cy.wait("@createTransaction");
>     
>     // Get the transaction ID from the URL
>     let transactionId;
>     cy.url().then(url => {
>         transactionId = url.split("/").pop();
>         
>         // Log out as User B
>         cy.getBySel("sidenav-signout").click();
>         
>         // Login as User A
>         cy.loginByXstate(ctx.userA.username);
>         
>         // Visit the transaction
>         cy.visit(`/transaction/${transactionId}`);
>         
>         // Like the transaction
>         cy.getBySel("like-button").click();
>         
>         // Verify the like is registered
>         cy.getBySel("like-count").should("contain", "1");
>         
>         // Log out as User A
>         cy.getBySel("sidenav-signout").click();
>         
>         // Login as User B to check for notifications
>         cy.loginByXstate(ctx.userB.username);
>         
>         // Navigate to notifications
>         cy.getBySel("sidenav-notifications").click();
>         cy.wait("@getNotifications");
>         
>         // Verify notification about the like exists
>         cy.getBySel("notification-list-item")
>             .first()
>             .should("contain", ctx.userA.firstName)
>             .and("contain", "liked");
>     });
> });
> ```
> 
> This implementation follows the scenario described in the test name, including creating a transaction to like, performing the like action, and verifying the notification appears for the right user.
